## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub with:

## Sending Code Changes (Pull Requests)

1. Fork the repo and make a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and follow the code style.
3. Test your changes on your computer.
4. Commit your changes with a clear message:

6. Open a pull request on GitHub and explain what you did.

## Code Style
